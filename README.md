## About
In this challenge, we, as Mobility Providers, are dedicated to creating the ultimate travel experience for our customers. Our goal is to engineer vehicles that seamlessly navigate the complexities of ever-changing situations, ensuring that passengers feel at ease and thoroughly enjoy their journey. We aim to innovate and push the boundaries of what's possible, making every trip not just a journey, but an experience to remember

## An example use-case

Detect driver's range anxiety through car's AI, engage Voice/Chat assist, obtain goal to locate and book charging station, process with context aware agent, activate search and booking service, notify driver of scheduled slot, authenticate at charging station, handle transaction autonomously, notify driver, continue journey with content driver. 

Users can simulate the scenario in [Metaverse](https://blog.bosch-digital.com/metaverse-a-place-for-education-and-training/) or use the hardware with provided [TechStack](#tech-stack-overview)
